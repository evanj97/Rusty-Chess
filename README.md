# Rusty-Chess

A chess game written purely in Rust for the purposes of learning the language.

Makes use of core Rust concepts, such as ownership, ownership borrowing, ownership transfer/moving, Options, Matching, and various macros.


**NOTE:**
This is NOT a perfectly optimized, ultra-lightweight implementation!  While still very efficient, I have made design choices to utilize and learn the elements of Rust that are unique to the language, or different from other languages I have used.  *It may or may not run on a potato clock.*
